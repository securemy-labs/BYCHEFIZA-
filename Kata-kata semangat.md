<b>E-Commerce WEBSITE</b>

[E-commerce is the buying and selling of goods and services over the internet. Almost anything can be purchased through e-commerce today, and it has lowered the barriers to entry for many types of businesses, such as retailers.]

<b>SYSTEM</b>

[ A management information system (MIS) is a computer-based system that collects, processes, and organizes a company's data to help managers make better decisions. In simple terms, it takes raw data and turns it into useful reports that managers can use to plan, control, and analyze business operations, ultimately making the organization run more efficiently. 
Collects and organizes data: It gathers information from various parts of the business, such as sales, finance, and human resources.
Provides tools for analysis: It gives managers tools to analyze this data to understand performance and identify trends.
Supports decision-making: By presenting organized information in reports, it helps leaders make informed choices about things like resource allocation and strategy.
Includes people, processes, and technology: An MIS is not just software; it's a combination of the hardware and software, the people who use it, and the procedures for using it effectively. ]

Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
